In some classification problems, datasets we have do not include balanced target labels. For instance, there might be five thousand "0" while there are only 200 "1".
In this cases, our model won't behave correctly and most probably it will only predict "0".

This repository includes various methods to avoid these problems while working on imbalanced datasets.I investigated class_weight tuning, oversampling (SMOTE) and threshold tuning.

Dataset I used: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset 

Note_1: "rdf.csv" is dataset which is preprocessed to use for each method.
Note_2: I inspired from different developers and websites.
